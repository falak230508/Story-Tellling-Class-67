One day at our school, during the lunch break, my friends ,  Gunika and Sahej , and we were casually chatting with each other.
After some time, we started discussing about our talents and capabilities.
I boasted about my great cycling skills and that I was the best at cycling among all of us.
Gunika and Sahej were impressed after hearing the praises of my cycling.
The next day, we all decided to go for a cycling tour for a few hours in the evening sun.
I thought this was the perfect opportunity to show my cycling skills to Gunika and Sahej.
We started cycling, chit-chatting to each other and enjoying till the end of our ropes.
Suddenly, out of the blue, a ferocious and scary dog came in front of me and started barking fiercely. 
I got so frightened due to the dog’s barking, that I had my heart in my mouth and fell off my cycle!
Seeing this, Gunika and Sahej started laughing at me.
I was showing off my skills yesterday and now I had fallen just by a dog’s bark.
I was a bit embarrassed, but forgetting that even I started giggling with my friends.
Really, this was the most hilarious moment of my life.
I enjoyed a lot .
We had a good time together .
